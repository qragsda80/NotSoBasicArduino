We are learning to code using an Arduino Uno.

## LEDBlinkRevisited

### Description

I took two wires with male ends. I plugged one end of the first wire into the GND port on the arduino and the other end into e1 on the bread board. For the second wire, I plugged one end into the number 9 spot on the arduino and the other end into j2 on the bread board. I then took a resistor and plugged it into e2 and g2. I took the LED light and plugged the longer end into a1 and the shorter end into a2. I took the hdmi cord and plugged it into my computer. From there, I went into the examples tab in Arduino Create and downloaded the "fade" example. I messed around with how fast it faded and it worked!

### Reflection

This was my first arduino module in Arduino Create. I liked coding, but I think 3D designing is more fun. I feel like I can be more creative that way. I will probably be doing the 3D designing part for the final project. I messed around with the speed of the fade and put it up to 5,000. I took a video in slo-mo and it looked really cool. I had fun with this assignment.

### Description

I took two wires with male ends. I plugged one end of the first wire into the GND port on the arduino and the other end into j2 on the bread board. For the second wire, I plugged one end into the number 13 spot on the arduino and the other end into -1 on the bread board. I then took a resistor and plugged it into -2 and a2. I took the LED light and plugged the longer end into e2 and the shorter end into f2. I took the hdmi cord and plugged it into my computer. Mr. Dierold helped me with the code in class and got it working!
